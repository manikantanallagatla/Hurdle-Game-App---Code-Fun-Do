To create animation of player running we have played series of images in sequence very fastly. To jump when an hurdle comes, 
We have given a jump button when it is pressed a sequence of other images are runned to show that player has taken a jump.
To create the animation of Hurdle moving we have moved the image of Hurdle to left each time sequentially. The timing of the 
Hurdle coming is set to be random.
